 Wow, that is exciting. On San Ramon Valley Boulevard?
 Yep. No, no, no. On the freeway.
 On the freeway? You're racing on the freeway?
 Yes.
 Sherry.
 No, he was racing. He was racing in my car.
 So, I theoretically could be the victim.
 You could be the victim.
 It's not on your insurance policy, is it?
 Not that they're aware of.
 If the officer says license and registration, you know.
 The beauty of that is my son is a good son.
 Oh, he wins.
 So, if I end up in jail, I would hope he would bail me out.
 Although, he says he won't.
 Although, you gotta figure, too, if he gets pulled over, he's got some magic code word that he says, and then.
 He's an attorney. He can talk his way out of it.
 Well, I'm Jim. This is Dr. Pulgini.
 Nice to meet you.
 Nice to meet you, as well. We've been looking at this name all day.
 Peffernoose.
 Peffernoose. Is it from a book? Is it?
 No. Peffernoose is a cookie.
 Really?
 Yes. It's a German cookie.
 It looks kind of like a Mexican wedding cake where it's rolled in powdered sugar, but it has different ingredients in it.
 And when I first got him, he had wandered into somebody's yard.
 His fur was all the way down to the ground.
 He weighed four pounds.
 He was about three years old.
 And he looked like a Peffernoose cookie.
 So, that's what I named him.
 Is that Peffernoose or is this Peffernoose?
 This is Phoenix.
 I live in Rossmoor and there are steps up to my house and he has no problem going all the way up.
 There are like seven steps.
 Okay. You go on walks with him?
 Oh, I take him for walks throughout the day.
 And he's got energy on his walks?
 Yeah.
 Great. Very good.
 And then, with him, how do you think his vision is?
 I think that his vision is decreased and I do think that he's deaf.
 Okay, that's my next question. Alright.
 Because when I call him, sometimes he doesn't even turn around.
 Or else he's very good at ignoring me.
 Can he hear the refrigerator door open?
 No.
 Okay.
 So, he doesn't hear when you're preparing food or anything?
 No. And, you know, I work from home and he comes and he goes to sleep in the office.
 And I will call him to, you know, kind of say his name to get a treat.
 And he doesn't wake up.
 Okay. Yeah. So, then he's not selectively listening. He has hearing loss.
 I still think he's a little...
 I mean, it is something that happens to males as they age. They get selective hearing, but you know
 Any recent vomiting?
 How about change in his stool?
 No.
 Any persistent coughing or sneezing?
 No.
 Any limping or lameness?
 No.
 And then water consumption for him. Increased, decreased, about the same?
 About the same, normal.
 Great.
 Do you have any specific concerns on him today?
 Not really. Just that he... I mean, he's... He's... his, his, I won't, I won't let his him, I won't let him have his teeth cleaned because I'm afraid of putting him under.
 Ok.
 So, my lifelong dream was to be a veterinarian.
 Oh, really?
